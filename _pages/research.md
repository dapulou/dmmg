# Research Areas

Our research focuses on understanding the effect of length and time scales on mechanisms of plasticity and incorporating this knowledge in physically-based models. We combine experimental and computational approaches to investigate:

## High Strain-Rate Deformation
- Dynamic behavior of materials
- Shock loading and impact studies
- Microstructural evolution during high strain-rate deformation

## Creep Mechanisms
- High-temperature deformation behavior
- Microstructural stability
- Life prediction models
- Creep-fatigue interaction

## Strengthening Mechanisms
- Precipitation hardening
- Grain boundary strengthening
- Dislocation-particle interactions
- Multi-scale modeling of strength

## Tribology in Metallic Systems
- Wear mechanisms in metals and alloys
- Surface engineering
- Friction studies
- Intermetallic coatings

## Computational Materials Science
- Molecular dynamics simulations
- Crystal plasticity modeling
- Multi-scale modeling approaches
- Mechanistic understanding of deformation
